# Figma to Next.js Conversion

This repository contains a Next.js project where I converted a Figma design into a fully functional Next.js application.

## Project Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The design was implemented using Tailwind CSS for styling and optimized for performance and responsiveness.

## Features

- Fully responsive UI based on the provided Figma design
- Built with Next.js and optimized for performance
- Styled using Tailwind CSS
- Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for font optimization
- Easily deployable on Vercel
